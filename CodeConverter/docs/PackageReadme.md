## About

Convert VB.NET to/from C#

This NuGet package is useful if you're building a tool which converts code, or if you want finer-grained control over what's converted.
See https://github.com/icsharpcode/CodeConverter for a pre-built command line, Visual Studio extension and Web converter.

## Features
* Accurate: Full project context (through Roslyn) is used to get the most accurate conversion.
* Actively developed: User feedback helps us continuously strive for a more accurate conversion.
* Completely free and open source
